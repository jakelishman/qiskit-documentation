# MCXRecursive

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive" />

`MCXRecursive(num_ctrl_qubits=None, label=None, ctrl_state=None)`[GitHub](https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.18/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/x.py "view source code")

Bases: `qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.x.MCXGate`

Implement the multi-controlled X gate using recursion.

Using a single ancilla qubit, the multi-controlled X gate is recursively split onto four sub-registers. This is done until we reach the 3- or 4-controlled X gate since for these we have a concrete implementation that do not require ancillas.

Create new MCX gate.

## Methods Defined Here

### get\_num\_ancilla\_qubits

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.get_num_ancilla_qubits" />

`static MCXRecursive.get_num_ancilla_qubits(num_ctrl_qubits, mode='recursion')`[GitHub](https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.18/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/x.py "view source code")

Get the number of required ancilla qubits.

### inverse

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.inverse" />

`MCXRecursive.inverse()`[GitHub](https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.18/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/x.py "view source code")

Invert this gate. The MCX is its own inverse.

## Attributes

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.ctrl_state" />

### ctrl\_state

Return the control state of the gate as a decimal integer.

**Return type**

`int`

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.decompositions" />

### decompositions

Get the decompositions of the instruction from the SessionEquivalenceLibrary.

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.definition" />

### definition

Return definition in terms of other basic gates. If the gate has open controls, as determined from self.ctrl\_state, the returned definition is conjugated with X without changing the internal \_definition.

**Return type**

`List`

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.duration" />

### duration

Get the duration.

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.label" />

### label

Return instruction label

**Return type**

`str`

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.name" />

### name

Get name of gate. If the gate has open controls the gate name will become:

> \<original\_name\_o\<ctrl\_state>

where \<original\_name> is the gate name for the default case of closed control qubits and \<ctrl\_state> is the integer value of the control state for the gate.

**Return type**

`str`

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.num_ancilla_qubits" />

### num\_ancilla\_qubits

The number of ancilla qubits.

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.num_ctrl_qubits" />

### num\_ctrl\_qubits

Get number of control qubits.

**Returns**

The number of control qubits for the gate.

**Return type**

int

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.params" />

### params

Get parameters from base\_gate.

**Returns**

List of gate parameters.

**Return type**

list

**Raises**

**CircuitError** – Controlled gate does not define a base gate

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.unit" />

### unit

Get the time unit of duration.
